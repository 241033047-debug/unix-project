Quiz Bash Script – Project Description

This is a simple, menu-driven Bash Quiz Application that reads questions from a text file and conducts a fully interactive quiz in the terminal. The user can choose to start the quiz, view instructions, or exit through a clean and easy-to-use menu.

Questions are stored in a structured format inside questionspr.txt and are automatically parsed by the script. Each question includes multiple-choice options, and the user answers by entering the correct option number. At the end, the script displays the final score.

This project demonstrates:

Bash scripting

File handling

Menu-driven UI

String parsing with IFS

User input handling

Perfect for beginners learning Bash and CLI-based application design.
